description: Deeply analyze a Linear ticket before implementation â€” pass a ticket ID or leave blank to let Claude infer it

<!--
If $ARGUMENTS is blank, infer the ticket ID from context.
If it can't be inferred, ask the user to supply one and stop.

Ultrathink about the comprehensive discovery needed before implementation. What context, risks, and unknowns must be uncovered to ensure a successful implementation that passes review on the first attempt?

Analyze **$ARGUMENTS** deeply:

## 1. Requirements Analysis

- Parse the ticket description and acceptance criteria
- Identify explicit and implicit requirements
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Define success metrics and validation criteria

## 2. Technical Discovery

- Review existing code and architecture patterns
- Identify files and components that need modification
- Check for similar implementations to follow as patterns
- Assess technical complexity and estimated effort

## 3. Risk Assessment

- What could go wrong during implementation?
- Are there backward compatibility concerns?
- Performance implications to consider?
- Security considerations?
- What edge cases need handling?

## 4. Dependencies & Blockers

- Check for dependencies on other tickets or systems
- Verify all necessary access and permissions
- Identify any potential blockers
- Confirm prerequisite work is completed

## 5. Documentation Review

- Review existing documentation for context
- Identify documentation that will need updates:
  - Code comments and inline docs
  - API documentation
  - README or setup guides
  - Architecture documentation
  - User-facing documentation

## 6. Testing Strategy

- Define unit test scenarios covering all business logic
- Plan integration tests for API changes
- Consider mutation testing targets (85% threshold)
- Identify any manual testing needs
- Plan for edge cases and error scenarios

## 7. Implementation Plan

- Break down into logical implementation steps
- Identify the optimal order of changes
- Plan checkpoints for validation
- Estimate time for each phase
- Define rollback strategy if needed

Present a concise summary with:

- Key insights discovered
- Critical risks to watch
- Recommended implementation approach
- Documentation updates needed
- Testing strategy highlights
- Go/No-Go recommendation with reasoning
