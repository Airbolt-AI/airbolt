description: Deeply analyze a Linear ticket before implementation â€” pass a ticket ID or leave blank to let Claude infer it

<!--
If $ARGUMENTS is blank, infer the ticket ID from context.
If it can't be inferred, ask the user to supply one and stop.

Ultrathink about the comprehensive discovery needed before implementation. What context, risks, and unknowns must be uncovered to ensure a successful implementation that passes review on the first attempt?

**Core Principle**: The best code is no code. Before writing anything, ensure you're solving the right problem in the simplest way possible. Over-analysis beats over-engineering.

## 0. Prepare Fresh Environment

Ensure you're starting from a clean, up-to-date state:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Analyze **$ARGUMENTS** deeply:

## 1. Requirements Analysis

- Parse the ticket description and acceptance criteria
- **Compare ticket requirements against current codebase state**
- **Is the ticket outdated? Have requirements changed since creation?**
- **Do any requirements need modification based on current implementation?**
- Identify explicit and implicit requirements
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Define success metrics and validation criteria

## 2. Technical Discovery

- Review existing code and architecture patterns
- Identify files and components that need modification
- Check for similar implementations to follow as patterns
- Assess technical complexity and estimated effort

## 3. Risk Assessment

- What could go wrong during implementation?
- Are there backward compatibility concerns?
- Performance implications to consider?
- Security considerations?
- What edge cases need handling?

## 4. Dependencies & Blockers

- Check for dependencies on other tickets or systems
- Verify all necessary access and permissions
- Identify any potential blockers
- Confirm prerequisite work is completed

## 5. Documentation Review

- Review existing documentation for context
- **Keep documentation minimal, clear, and focused on value**
- Identify documentation that will need updates:
  - Code comments (only for complex logic)
  - API documentation (only if endpoints change)
  - README (only if setup/usage changes)
  - Architecture docs (only if patterns change)
- Remember: The best documentation is code that doesn't need explanation

## 6. Testing Strategy

- Define unit test scenarios covering all business logic
- Plan integration tests for API changes
- **Aim for zero manual testing through comprehensive automation**
- **Mutation testing (85% threshold)**: Ensures tests detect meaningful logic errors, not just achieve coverage
  - Required for business logic in `utils/` directories
  - Not needed for: routes, plugins, config, simple getters/setters
  - Ask: "If I break this logic, will my tests fail?"
- Plan for edge cases and error scenarios
- If manual testing seems necessary, ask: "How can we automate this?"

## 7. Testing Strategy

When planning implementation, identify test strategy early:

- **Property tests** for complex logic (retry, concurrency, data transformations)
- **Integration tests** for complete workflows (auth flows, API contracts)
- **Unit tests** for pure functions only (calculations, validations)
- **Mutation tests** for critical decisions (auth checks, rate limits)

Focus on behavior over implementation - avoid coverage theatre.

## 8. Implementation Plan

- Break down into logical implementation steps
- Identify the optimal order of changes
- Plan checkpoints for validation
- Estimate time for each phase
- Define rollback strategy if needed

Present a concise summary with:

- Key insights discovered
- Critical risks to watch
- **Ticket updates needed (if any)**
- Recommended implementation approach
- Documentation updates needed
- Testing strategy highlights
- Go/No-Go recommendation with reasoning

If the ticket needs updates based on current codebase state, suggest specific changes to the Linear ticket before proceeding with implementation.
