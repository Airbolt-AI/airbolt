description: Start and implement a Linear ticket — pass a ticket ID or leave blank to let Claude infer it
---

<!--
If $ARGUMENTS is blank, infer the ticket ID.
If it can’t be inferred, ask the user to supply one and stop.

Always begin work from a fresh branch based on the latest main:

  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -B feature/$ARGUMENTS   # recreates branch if it exists

Abort (notify the user) if any command fails.
-->

!`git checkout main && git pull origin main`
!`[ -n "$ARGUMENTS" ] && git checkout -B feature/$ARGUMENTS`

Ultrathink about what makes an exceptional implementation that passes strict code review on the first attempt—one that demonstrates true software craftsmanship within our established architecture and quality standards.

Then Ultrathink about the specific context of **$ARGUMENTS**: business value, technical complexity, user impact, and integration points. What would a senior architect prioritize? What could go wrong?

Move **$ARGUMENTS** to 'In Progress' (if not already) and implement it completely—from fresh branch to ready-for-review PR—while embodying those exceptional standards. Adapt your approach based on the ticket’s nature, but maintain our quality guardrails throughout. Ensure the implementation uses as little code and configuration to deliver as much user value as possible in the most maintainable way.

Use Linear MCP tools, our quality pipeline commands, and Git workflows as needed. Don’t move to 'Done'—that’s handled post-review.
