This command has been renamed to `/prepare-pr` to better reflect its purpose of preparing pull requests.

Please use `/prepare-pr` instead - it provides the same comprehensive validation and PR creation functionality with enhanced breaking change analysis.

All existing functionality is preserved in the new command.
